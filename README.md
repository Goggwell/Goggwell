- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on **building a companion app for [Cassette Beasts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/)!**

- üå± I'm also looking into open-source contributions and honing my skills as a software engineer by focusing on building side projects using technologies I am unfamiliar with. I am hoping that I will learn a lot about clean code and collaboration through working on open-source repos.

### Latest Note (17/01/2024 @12:06AM) - I update this note on every commit (same as the commit description)
Working on a couple of projects right now...

One of them is a clone of [Hexcodle](https://hexcodle.com), which is a color-based Wordle-like game. My version will incorporate 6 color formats (RGB, Hex, HSL, display-p3, LCH, OKLCH), and is built different üò§ (but literally, it is built different, cause I'm using React + Vite with TypeScript instead of Next.js).
I have not abandoned [OliveUp](https://github.com/Goggwell/OliveUp) don't worry! Priorities have shifted elsewhere at the moment, and I will come back to it on a later date.

In other news, I've submitted a PR to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/)! First PR for a pretty large open-source repo.
My reason for doing so was to update some type definitions for a recently updated function in the [culori](https://github.com/Evercoder/culori) library (`clampChroma`). Also got to learn some new stuff in the process!
