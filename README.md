### Latest Note (25/11/2023 @2:45AM) - I update this note on every commit (same as the commit description)
Work on [OliveUp](https://github.com/Goggwell/OliveUp) is going smoothly. Managed to cobble together a working route with some infinite scrolling action, and a decent looking nested route (chart powered by [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks))! Will have to postpone work on our app for now as I kinda need to update my personal website. Unfortunately it is severely outdated, and I plan on rewriting much of the codebase.
