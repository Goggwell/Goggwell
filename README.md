- 🔭 I’m currently working on **building a new personal website in the style of a desktop operating system!**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **the T3 stack** so I can be a more well-rounded engineer. 

- 🌱 Also looking into large-scale application and system design by 
  * implementing *test-driven development* with **Cypress, Jest, and React Testing Library**, 
  * *continuous integration* with **Github Actions**, 
  * and *monorepos* with **Turborepo**.

### Latest Note (3/10/2022 @4:00AM) - I update this note on every commit (same as the commit description)
Safe to say I am no longer adhering to the MERN stack 😆 

It's no secret I've been heavily focused on the frontend as of late, so I want to delve deeper into the backend so I can round out my skillset and be a more valuable developer. 

Currently working on a new portfolio that will be the culmination of what I have learned as an engineer thus far (after being employed for a year). Don't want to over-complicate the project, however, so I'll be using newer technologies in other projects (planning on improving my quiz application, and wanting to develop a website similar to [gg.deals](https://gg.deals).

Some frameworks/libraries I've been keen on taking a look into are Astro and Qwik (relatively new frameworks that promise fast speeds), Zustand and Jotai (Redux/Context alternatives), Turborepo and NX (monorepo build systems), and the T3 stack (mainly tRPC and Prisma, since I want to improve my backend)
