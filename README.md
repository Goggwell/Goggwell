- 🔭 I’m currently working on **building a companion app for [Cassette Beasts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/)!**

- 🌱 I'm also looking into open-source contributions and honing my skills as a software engineer by focusing on building side projects using technologies I am unfamiliar with. I am hoping that I will learn a lot about clean code and collaboration through working on open-source repos.

### Latest Note (11/01/2024 @1:01PM) - I update this note on every commit (same as the commit description)
Right now I'm looking for several open-source projects that I could potentially contribute to. I'm mainly doing this to further develop my current skillset, and it's also a nice way of meeting new people (particularly in the development space). I'm also looking at a bunch of popular open-source repos for project ideas or cool features that I could try to replicate or build with another method. There is a lot to learn, and I truly know nothing 😅
